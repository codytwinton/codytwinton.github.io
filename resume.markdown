## Background

I am completely self-taught. When I was hired at both Zappend & Credntia, I started as an iOS Developer. Within 4 months at Zappend and less than a year at Credntia, I became Project Manager, later stepping into the CEO role at Credntia. I handled both task management and management of the teams for iOS, Android, front-end, and back-end development. I also led in the development of ideas & features, as well as maintaining quality in our work. I've worked with clients and customers alike to ensure an excellent user experience.
